# ClassicalMC_Julia

Description: 

  Classical MonteCarlo code written in Julia for a square lattice spin model.
  
  Using Metropolis altorithm with local update scheme.

Purpose:

  Simulation of a magnet with

  NN Exchange interaction
  
  On-site uniaxial anisotropy
  
  Homogeneous zeeman field

  at finite temperature.
